# FlaskApp_with_Graphs

The objective of this exercise is to create a web application that displays an interactive plot of oceanic currents. The 
plot should show the intensity of the currents, which is measured in knots. 
The data for the oceanic currents is provided in two tab-delimited files: one for the u vector 
component of the currents (in m/s) and one for the v vector component of the currents (in m/s). 
The intensity of the currents can be calculated from the u and v components using the following formula:
intensity = sqrt(u^2 + v^2) * 1.94
where 1.94 is a conversion factor from m/s to knots

The Framework used :
1. Flask

Languages Used:
1. Python 3
2. Html5
