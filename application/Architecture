A simple Flask Application is used here so as to demonstate the simple and easy to use architecture of the framework. Other framworks like 
Django could have been used also, but for a task this small they would just serve as boiler plate code. 
Flask is used over a simple html site or django to show its easy to use architecture and simplicity. Flask helps to integrate Html and CSS pages and other 
pages in its framework. for a small and efficient application flask has proved to be sufficient and fast.
Since this application didnt need a Database, an api was not needed to configure. Also since it is a one page application we didnt need to configure an admin page
or password protection was not needed.

Plotly express is used so as to give interactive graphs to the client side, Plotly is a more sophisticated data visualization tool that
